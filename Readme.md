ICT Club Resources
==================
Here are various resources used by Softwire for our after school ICT club.

Scratch
-------
Scratch is a simple graphical programming language.
We have written some worksheets for the children to follow to build some games.

Lego Mindstorms
---------------
We are using the NXT Python library to write python programs to control lego mindstorms robots.
We have written wrappers for the library, to make writting the programs a bit easier for children.
